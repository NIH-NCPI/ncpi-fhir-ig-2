ITWIN should be used for all monozygotic multiples (triplets, quadruplets, etc.) and should be present for all the directions of the relationship. This provides an unambiguous representation of the relationship. Example: A,B,C are triplets. You need A→B, B→A, A→C, C→A, B→C, C→B. If X and Y are twins, you need X→Y and Y→X. If Q is the grandchild of R but Q's parent is outside the dataset, then you need to make a dummy D with unknown sex and age and make Q-(NCHILD)→D and D-(NCHILD)→R. Values like mother and son are redundant with the sex of the participants and unnecessarily reductive.",
