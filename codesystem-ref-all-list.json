HPO currently contains over 13,000 terms and over 156,000 annotations to hereditary diseases. The HPO project and others have developed software for phenotype-driven differential diagnostics, genomic diagnostics, and translational research. The HPO is a flagship product of the Monarch Initiative, an NIH-supported international consortium dedicated to semantic integration of biomedical and model organism data with the ultimate goal of improving biomedical research. The HPO, as a part of the Monarch Initiative, is a central component of one of the 13 driver projects in the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) strategic roadmap.\"\r\n\r\nPlease see https://hpo.jax.org/app/download/ontology.\r\n\r\nReleases, produced approximately every 2 months, can be found [here](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/releases).",

LOINC's universal identifiers (names and codes) can be used in the context of order and observation exchanges between information systems that use syntax standards such as HL73, CEN TC251, ISO TC215, ASTM4, and DICOM. Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.",

      "description" : "The Mondo Disease Ontology is a semi-automatically constructed ontology that merges in multiple disease resources to yield a coherent merged ontology that contains cross-species disease terminology.\r\n\r\nNumerous sources for disease definitions and data models currently exist, which include HPO, OMIM, SNOMED CT, ICD, PhenoDB, MedDRA, MedGen, ORDO, DO, GARD, etc; however, these sources partially overlap and sometimes conflict, making it difficult to know definitively how they relate to each other. This has resulted in a proliferation of mappings between disease entries in different resources; however mappings are problematic: collectively, they are expensive to create and maintain. Most importantly, the mappings lack completeness, accuracy, and precision; as a result, mapping calls are often inconsistent between resources. The UMLS provides intermediate concepts through which other resources can be mapped, but these mappings suffer from the same challenges: they are not guaranteed to be one-to-one, especially in areas with evolving disease concepts such as rare disease.\r\n\r\nIn order to address the lack of a unified disease terminology that provides precise equivalences between disease concepts, we created Mondo, which provides a logic-based structure for unifying multiple disease resources.\r\n\r\nMondo’s development is coordinated with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), which describes the individual phenotypic features that constitute a disease. Like the HPO, Mondo provides a hierarchical structure which can be used for classification or “rolling up” diseases to higher level groupings. It provides mappings to other disease resources, but in contrast to other mappings between ontologies, we precisely annotate each mapping using strict semantics, so that we know when two disease names or identifiers are equivalent or one-to-one, in contrast to simply being closely related.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see [https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/)",
