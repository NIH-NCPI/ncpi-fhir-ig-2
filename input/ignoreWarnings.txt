# I copied this code system URL from https://terminology.hl7.org/6.4.0/NamingSystem-v3-nciThesaurus.html So, I know it's correct. It is just a failing of the terminology server that it cannot find it.

# I think this error is a bug in the terminology server - I'm clearly using 3.0.0 of the code system (terminology version - which is different from FHIR release), but it gives an error for 4.3.0 even though that string appears nowhere in the repo.

# A Sushi bug validating URLs. I spent a lot of time for the AirTable.com URL. And I backed it up with two LLM discussions: https://chatgpt.com/share/6891176d-d27c-8003-ae04-6f8e818052f5 and https://claude.ai/share/5796b856-67e6-4203-976a-0b621defcda7 For other URLs, I checked that the code looked valid and that the URL worked in a browser.

# It looks like NcpiFamilyTypes is intentionally a fragment, so I'm removing the warning. We might want to change it to #complete if the #fragment designation was just supposed to last until we'd discussed the options and increment the version when we add missing options.
INFORMATION: ValueSet/ncpi-family-types-vs: ValueSet.compose.include[0]: The value set references CodeSystem 'https://nih-ncpi.github.io/ncpi-fhir-ig-2/CodeSystem/ncpi-family-types' which has status 'fragment'
