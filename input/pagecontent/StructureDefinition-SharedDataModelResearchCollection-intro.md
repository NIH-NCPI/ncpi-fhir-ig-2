### Shared Data Model Research Collection

#### Basic Definition
The collection element allows for high level organization of objects into various related groups. One common type of collection is a consortium, but other collections can also be established.  Items in a collection can include studies, datasets, or other collections (for example, if consortium A becomes a member of consortium B, the collection that represents consortium A can be added as an item in the collection representing consortium B).
