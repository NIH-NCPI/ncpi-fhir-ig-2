### Assays

The assay model is currently under revision, and does not have a structure that is ready for release at this time.  However, we recognize that a subset of assay metadata is necessary to support, even if we do not have a full model finalized.  For that reason, assay information that is relevant to the use of specific files can be found in the module information for file metadata.
