# Informatics Assay Requests

The `NcpiAssay` profile is based on the `ServiceRequest` resource and is used to represent informatics assay orders such as whole genome sequencing or RNA-seq. It enables traceability and linkages to specimens, patients, and supporting evidence.


## Key Features of `NcpiAssay`

1. **Status and Intent**:
   - The `status` field indicates the current state of the assay request (e.g., `#active`).
   - The `intent` field specifies the purpose of the request (e.g., `#order`).

2. **Code**:
   - The `code` field uses standardized terminologies such as LOINC to describe the type of assay being performed. For example, `86206-0` represents "Whole genome sequencing analysis."

3. **Subject**:
   - The `subject` field links the assay to a specific `Patient` or `Group`. This allows assays to be associated with individuals or cohorts.

4. **Specimens**:
   - The `specimen` field references one or more `Specimen` resources that are used in the assay. This ensures traceability to the biological materials analyzed.

5. **Reason for the Assay**:
   - The `reasonCode` field provides the clinical or research justification for the assay, such as "Investigating suspected hereditary condition."

6. **Authored Date**:
   - The `authoredOn` field records the date and time when the assay request was created.

7. **Tasks**:
   - The `Task` resource can be used to represent workflow steps or processes derived from the assay. For more details, see the [Task](https://hl7.org/fhir/task.html) resource.

8. **Files and Documents**:
   - The `DocumentReference` resource can be used to represent files or documents generated by the assay, such as BAM files or VCF files. For more details, see the [DocumentReference](https://hl7.org/fhir/documentreference.html) resource.

## Traceability and Provenance

The `NcpiAssay` profile supports detailed traceability by linking to related resources such as:
- **Specimens**: Biological materials analyzed in the assay.
- **Patients or Groups**: Individuals or cohorts associated with the assay.
- **Tasks**: Workflow steps or processes fulfilling the assay.
- **Files**: Outputs generated by the assay, such as BAM files.
