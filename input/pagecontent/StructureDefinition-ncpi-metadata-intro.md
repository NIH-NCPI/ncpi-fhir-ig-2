#### Key Guidelines
The NCPI File Metadata profile is based on the standard resource type, [Observation](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/observation.html) and is intended to represent information about the file metadata associated with a file.

##### Added Profile Restrictions
In order to ensure that our resources are interoperable across studies, we have employed a number of restrictions that should make consuming Patient resources more consistent.

The NCPI File Metadata profile is essentially a collection of slices built on one another. 

#### Recommended Practices

##### FHIR Mappings
The following fields from the shared data model are to be mapped to the NCPI File Metadata as shown below:
