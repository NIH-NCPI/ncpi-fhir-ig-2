# Motivation
The background context and problem this pull request is addressing

Example: The current FHIR Patient profile (Participant) does not include a critical field, birth sex, 
that is contained in the input data. This means that assigned sex at birth data does not get captured in the FHIR server.

# Approach
The solution to the problem

Example: Add an extension to the Participant profile to capture the Patient's assigned sex at birth.
