# ncpi-fhir-ig-2
Welcome to NCPI FHIR IG 2. The goal for this repository is to relaunch the IG project with a clearer focus, an explicit style guide using the current tools including Sushi v3. 

This repository is currently under development. Feel free to [take a look](https://torstees.github.io/ncpi-fhir-ig-2/) at the working version.
